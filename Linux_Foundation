Start your lab and practice

cd devopslab
vagrant status
vagrant up node1
vagrant status (Ensure node1 is running)
vagrant ssh node1

Stop your lab and exit

exit
vagrant halt node1


File System in Linux
===============

pwd - command to see the path of present working directory

/ - root partition

/root - root user’s home directory

/home - home directory for any other user other than root

/etc - contains all configuration files

/boot - contains all files related	to booting/boot loader of your system

/dev -contains all the files related to attached devices

/opt - contains all third party softwares

/var - contains all dynamic files and logs

/tmp - contains all temporary files

/bin - contains all commands for non privileged user

/sbin - contains all commands for privileged user

/proc - contains all process information

/sys - contains all system files


Booting Sequence
==============

BIOS
MBR
GRUB
Kernel
Init
Runlevel

Runlevels
=======

0 - shutdown

1- single user mode

2 - multi user mode without networking

3 - multi user with networking

4 - undefined

5 - full graphical mode

6 - reboot


Filesystem Path
============

Absolute path - start with a /

Relative Path - starts with ..

Creating and Editing files in linux
=========================

Touch - to create a blank file

I - insert text

Arrow keys - navigator

W - save

Q - quit

Wq - save and quit

Q! - quit with out saving

Gg - takes to being of file

G (shift g) - takes you bottom of the file

N gg or :n - takes you to a particular line number, where n is the number

U - undo

Ctrl r - redo

A - append

/string - searches the given string

%s/searchstring/replacestring/g - replaces the search string with replace string (where g stands for global)

How to replace the given string with in a specified line numbers
M,ns/searchstring/replacestring/g (where m and n are the ranges)


File Permissions
============

R - 4

W - 2

X - 1

      R w x r w x r w x
- - - - - - - - - - - 

File Owner
Group owner
Other (rest of the world/Public)

The first - represents a file type

- regular file
B - block file
C - character file
D - directory
L - linked file (can be created using ln command)
P - piped file
S - socket file

Redirectors
========

| - pipe

> - redirects results to the given file

>> - appends results to the given file

2> - redirects error messages to a file

&> - redirects everything to a file


Users, Groups permissions and ownership
================================

2 types of users
	- privileged user/ super user/ root
	- unprivileged users/ regular users

Useradd <username>

Passwd <username>

Groupadd <groupname>

/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/group

Chmod - change permissions of a file


Linux Processes and Managing Processes
================================

A process is a set of instructions loaded into memory.

	- numeric process ID (PID)
	- who is running the process
	- group id associated

Ps - lists all process ids along with other information

Ps -ef
Ps -aux

All the process can be associated with a signal

15 - terminate cleanly
9 - kill or terminate immediately	
1 - reread configuration files (HUP)

Kill -9 <pid>

Killall -9 <processname>

Pkill -9 pattern

W - displays a quick summary of system usage
Top - displays a detailed realtime information about running processes.

S --> Interruptible sleep(S) process which is waiting for an event to complete.
Ss --> A session leader(s) process in Interruptible sleep(S).
SN --> A low priority(N) process which is nice to others is in interruptible sleep(S).
S< s --> "<" indicates a high priority process and the process is a session leader(s) in interruptible sleep(S).
S< sl --> A multhi-threaded(l) high priority(<) session leader(s) process in interruptible sleep(S).
S< --> A high priroty(<) process in interruptible sleep(S).
SNl --> A low priority(N) multi-threaded(l) process in interruptible sleep(S) state.
SNs --> A low priority(N) session leader(s) process in interruptible sleep(S).
SN+ --> A low priority(N) interruptible sleep(S) process running in foreground(+).
R+ --> A foreground(+) running(R) process.
T - stopped process
Z - Zombie
I - Idle process


& - sends a job to background

Fg <jobid> - brings a job to foreground

Jobs - lists all the background jobs

Services and Daemons
=================

Systemctl [status/start/stop/restart] <servicename>

Status of a service: loaded/active(running)/active(exited)/active(waiting)/inactive

Enabled/disabled

Systemctl list-units —type=service

Chronyd - it is an application to schedule your jobs/tasks
